# llopen 

We are currently developing `llopen`.

- Run `$ ./virtualCable.sh` to create the virtual cable
- Run `$ ./build.sh` to build `write` and `read` to test llopen

Finally:

- Run `./read`  in one terminal then run `./write` in another 

# llread llwrite

## Byte stuffing/destuffing

- Tested escapping flag and the escape character and some combination of both 
- Still need to test full messeges!
